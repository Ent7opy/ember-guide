# UI principles
- Map page shows detections, wind barbs, probability heatmap; toggle pâ‰¥0.3/0.5/0.7.
- No heavy compute; all data via API.
- Include "last updated" timestamps and the non-tactical disclaimer.
- Download buttons for GeoTIFF/report; metrics page shows reliability plots.

# Tech
- Streamlit + pydeck/folium; avoid blocking calls; debounce filters.
