# Safety & ethics
- Always include: “Research preview — not for life-safety decisions.”
- Never imply evacuation or tactical guidance.
- Respect provider licenses (NASA/ECMWF/USGS/Copernicus) in footers.

# Security
- Do not read/write secrets; `.env*` are off-limits per .cursorignore.
- Never commit credentials; prefer env vars.

# Performance
- Avoid loading entire rasters into memory when tiling; stream/Windowed reads.
